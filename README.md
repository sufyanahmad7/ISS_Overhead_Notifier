## :book: Introduction
The International Space Station (ISS) makes its rounds around the world 24/7. And there is a good chance it may be above us. Hence, I have created a script that alerts me when it is above Singapore. All in the name of fun!


## :computer: Tech Stack
1. Script = Python
2. Cloud hosting = PythonAnywhere (runs the script at a set time everyday)


## :white_check_mark: Key Features (App Ready)

1. Simple script that triggers an email when ISS is overhead.

  
## :x: Limitations

1. Limited to emails only.

## :runner: Future improvements

1. Work on existing limitations by sending SMSes alerts as well.

Difficulty Level: :six:
